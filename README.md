# Portofolio-Salsabila-Nathania-Putri
Hi, I am Salsabila Nathania Putri! I am a Media Production student at Universitas Indonesia with a focus on IP Management and Media Storytelling. As the host and producer of Belajar Menjadi Dewasa, I delve into personal growth and life lessons.

This role has honed my skills not only in audio production and audience engagement, but also in media intelligence; using audience data and trend analysis to guide content strategy. Passionate about media innovation, I aim to leverage these insights to create meaningful and impactful content.
